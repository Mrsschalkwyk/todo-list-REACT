this is a loop that this is like an ELEMENTID
how to change the HTML with the user input

//app.js
function handleChange(event)
setValue(event.target.value)
... onchange=(habdlechange) //this is like an ELEMENTID for the html to change


event by event is induidual key presses. charactor by charactor

key={} this is HTML 


function handleSubmit- 
event.preventDefult();
when we detect a change in the input field we want to add withour 
refressing
when an item is submitted to the list we want to add it without 
refreshing the page and loosing everything.

when you see() after a functions it means do something
when there is nothijng after FUNCTION it means that you are passing something 
around

objects- are the same concept as pythion
